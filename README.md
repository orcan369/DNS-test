# DNS-test
This is the test set we used in the paper “SPECTRAL ADDITION AND ADAPTIVE FOCAL TRAINING FOR PERSONALIZED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT”,termed DNS-test.  
The three folders contain noisy speech,clean speech and enrollment speech respectively,and the corresponding relationship between them are recorded in the SCP files.And we provide several noisy and enhanced samples for listening.
